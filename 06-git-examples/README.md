- Collaboration workflows
- Branch management
- Conflict resolution
- Git configuration
- Advanced Git features

## Common Git Commands

### Basic Operations
```bash
git init          # Initialize a new repository
git add .         # Stage all changes
git commit -m ""  # Commit staged changes
git status        # Check repository status
git log           # View commit history
```

### Branching
```bash
git branch        # List branches
git checkout -b   # Create and switch to new branch
git merge         # Merge branches
git rebase        # Rebase branch
```

### Remote Operations
```bash
git remote add    # Add remote repository
git push          # Push changes to remote
git pull          # Pull changes from remote
git fetch         # Fetch remote changes
```

## Best Practices

1. Write clear commit messages
2. Use meaningful branch names
3. Keep commits atomic and focused
4. Regular commits and pushes
5. Pull before pushing
6. Review changes before committing
7. Use .gitignore appropriately
8. Maintain clean repository history
